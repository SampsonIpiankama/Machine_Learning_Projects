# Iris Dataset Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

**Objective:** Create the decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

## About the Dataset
The popular iris flower data set was used in this project. The dataset was downloaded directly [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Iq7YvbWZbt8VXjfm06brx66b10YiwK-/view). A description of the dataset can be found as an attribute of the python object created after loading the dataset.

## Python Libraries 
1. Pandas : To load and manipulate the data
2. Numpy :To calculate the mean and standard deviation
3. Seaborn : To draw graphs
4. Matplotlib : To draw graphs
5. Graphviz : To draw a graph in DOT format
6. Scikit-learn: For predictive data analysis

## Steps
1. Import the required packages into our python environment
2. Import the dataset and do some EDA on it
3. Data visualization on the dataset
4. Feature selection and data split
5. Modelling and evaluation
6. Visualize the decision tree using the graphviz library
7. Feed any new/ test data to this classifer to check if it would be able to predict the right class accordingly

## Model
The machine learning model was developed using the decision tree classifier in the scikit learn library. An accuracy of 100% was gotten. The best  possible score we can get is 1.0 and that's what we got.
