# Machine Learning Projects

Machine learning (ML) is the subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn—or improve performance—based on the data they consume. Artificial intelligence is a broad term that refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence. Machine learning and AI are often discussed together, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but they don’t mean the same thing. An important distinction is that although all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning.

In this repository, you'll find ML projects showcasing my skills and experience in data modeling and evaluation, probability and statistics, and the application of ML algorithms and Libraries.
